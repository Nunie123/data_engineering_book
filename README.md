# Online Data Engineering: Start to Finish
The completely free E-Book for setting up and running a Data Engineering stack on a major cloud platform.

## Preface

NOTE: This book is currently incomplete. If you find errors or would like to fill in the gaps, read the **Contributions** section below.

### Summary
This is a book designed to teach you all you need to know to set up a data engineering stack on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/). Each chapter will take a general concept in Data Engineering, discuss the concept generally, then go into implementation details for each cloud provider.

### Who This Book Is For
This book is for people with coding familiarity that are interested in setting up professional data pipelines and data warehouses using a modern cloud platform. I expect the readers to include:
* Data Engineers looking to learn a new cloud platform or learn more about a platform they are already familiar with.
* Junior Data Engineers looking to learn best practices for building and working with data engineering infrastructure.
* Software Engineers, DevOps Engineers, Data Scientists, Data Analysts, or anyone else that is tasked with performing Data Engineering functions to help them with their other work.

This books assumes familiarity with SQL and Python (if you're not familiar with Python, you should be able to muddle through with general programming experience). If you do not have experience with these languages (particularly SQL) it is recomended you learn these languages and then return to this book.

This book covers a lot of ground. Many of the subjects we'll cover in just part of a chapter will have entire books written about them. I will provide references for further research. Just know that while I aim for this book to be comprehensive in the sense that it provides all the information you need to get a stack up and running, I do not attempt the impossible task of compiling all the data engineering information you will ever need.

Finally, there are a vast array of data engineering tools that are in use. I cover many popular tools for data engineering, but many more have been left out of this book due to brevity and my lack of experience with them. If you feel I left off something important, please read the **Contributions** section below.

### How to Read This Book
This book is divided into chapters discussing major Data Engineering concepts and functions. Each chapter is then divided into four parts: an overview and then a seperate section for GCP, AWS, and Azure. 

You can read this book front-to-back if you're just looking to get a general familiarity with common tools on the major cloud platforms. Another good option is to pick a cloud platform and just read that section (plus the introduction) for each capter. Finally, if you know exactly what topic you want to learn more about, you'll have no trouble skipping to the chapter that has your interest.

I provide code samples in each chapter and you are encouraged to play around with the tools discussed in each chapter. Where applicable, I provide information about pricing both so you can price out your production infrastructure, and so you know how much it will cost to play around with it while learning.

If you think the book is wrong, missing information, or otherwise needs to be edited, there are two options:
1. Make a pull request (the preferred option). If you think something needs to be changed, fork this repo, make the change yourself, then send me a pull request. I'll review it, discuss it with you, if needed, then add it in. Easy peasy. If you're not very familiar with GitHub, instructions for doing this are [here](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).
2. Make an issue. Go to the issue tab above, click to create a new issue, then tell me what you think is wrong, preferably including references to specific line numbers.

I look forward to working with you all.
